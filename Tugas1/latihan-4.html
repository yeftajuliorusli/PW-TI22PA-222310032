        <h1><b>The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages <br>to Learn in 2022</br></b></h1>

        <p> There's no question that software programming is a hot carrer right now. The <font color=“red”>U.S. <br>Bureau of Labor Statistics</font> project 21 percent growth for programming jobs from</br>
            2018 to 2028, which is more than four times average for all occupations. What's<br>
            more, the median annual pay for the software programmer is about $106.000, which</br>
            is nearly three times the median for all U.S. workers</p>

        <p>Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies,<br>
            and types of software require knowing and understanding different</br> 
            programming languages—and it’s often beneficial to know multiple <br>
            languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming can be a</br> 
            daunting experience, especially for professionals with no prior programming <br>
            experience.</br></p>

        <p><font color="blue"><u>The Master of Science in Computer Science Align program</u></font> at Northeastern 
            <br>University is specifically designed for students who want to transition into</br> 
            computer science from another field of study.</p>

        <p>
            <i>"Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds<br> 
            and have them come out as software engineers,"
            </i>says Ian Gorton, PhD and</br> director of the graduate computer science programs at Northeastern<br>
            University—Seattle. <i>"We focus on math, programming, and a variety of</br>
            computer science and engineering concepts."</i></p>

        <p>Whether you’re new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, it<br> 
            helps to know which languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the most</br> 
            popular programming languages of 2020 based on the number of job postings<br> 
            listed on job search sites Indeed, the average annual salary for those jobs, and</br> 
            factors such as ease of use and potential for growth.</p>
